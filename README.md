# Predicting House Prices: A Kaggle Competition

The main aim of this project is to predict the sales price for each house.

The housing market is one of the most crucial parts of the economy for every country. Predicting house prices is a challenging task due to the variety of factors that can influence the price. These can range from the square footage to the location, to the number of bedrooms or even the year the house was built. Understanding these factors can lead to more accurate predictions and can potentially reveal interesting insights about the housing market.

In this project, I will start by exploring the dataset provided by the competition, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing. Afterward, I will build a machine learning model to predict the house prices.

I hope that you will find it interesting and informative.

Let's dive into the data!
